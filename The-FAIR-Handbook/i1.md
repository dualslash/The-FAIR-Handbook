# Knowledge Representation

</br>

Humans should be able to exchange and interpret each other’s data (so preferably do not use dead languages). But this also applies to computers, meaning that data that should be readable for machines without the need for specialised or ad hoc algorithms, translators, or  mappings. 

Interoperability typically means that each computer system at least has knowledge of the other system’s data exchange formats. For this to happen and to ensure automatic findability and interoperability of datasets, it is critical to use (1) commonly used controlled vocabularies, ontologies, thesauri (having resolvable globally unique  and persistent identifiers, see F1) and (2) a good data model (a well-defined framework to describe and structure (meta)data).
