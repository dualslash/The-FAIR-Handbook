# WMO - Medical-scientific Research with persons

</br>
The ‘Wet Medisch-Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek met Mensen’ (henceforth WMO) settles the requirements for executing scientific research with human beings in the medical domain. It contains as well the requirements for clinical trials. Consent in the WMO is exclusively oriented towards providing consent for participating to the research that is envisioned and relates to providing information concerning the risks, and rights and obligations concerning opting-in and opting-out to this research. The law does not contain specific requirements concerning consent in relation to processing of personal data.
