# Reusable

</br>

The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings. 

</br>

*For data to be considered Reusable, they should follow the following guidelines.*

1. Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes 
   1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license 
   2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance 
   3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards
