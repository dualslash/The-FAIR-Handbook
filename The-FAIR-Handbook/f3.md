# Metadata Linkage

This is a simple and obvious principle, but of critical importance to FAIR. The metadata and the dataset they describe are usually separate files. The association between a metadata file and the dataset should be made explicit by mentioning a datasetâ€™s globally unique and persistent identifier in the metadata. 

As stated in F1, many repositories will generate globally unique and persistent identifiers for deposited  datasets that can be used for this purpose.
