# Rich Metadata

</br>

In creating FAIR digital resources, metadata can (and should) be  generous and extensive, including descriptive information about the  context, quality and condition, or characteristics of the data. Rich  metadata allow a computer to automatically accomplish routine and  tedious sorting and prioritising tasks that currently demand a lot of  attention from researchers. 

The rationale behind this principle is that  someone should be able to find data based on the information provided by their metadata, even without the data’s identifier. As such, compliance with F2 helps people to locate your data, and increase re-use and  citations. 

Rich metadata implies that you should not presume that you know who will want to use your data, or for what purpose. So, as a rule  of thumb, you should never say ‘this metadata isn’t useful’; be generous and provide it anyway!
