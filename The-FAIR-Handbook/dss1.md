There are many different ways in which data can be exchanged, and in order to get a grip on these different techniques we formalise them as **Data Sharing Strategies**. In this section we will cover three techniques in particular.

From Copy and Download, Researcher to Data and finally Model to Data, these techniques provide increasing capacity for security, reliability and privacy while also being increasing complexity to implement. 

Depending on the specific needs, a balance may be struck between implementation feasibility and requirements for security, privacy and reliability. In the following pages we will describe these strategies and both their advantages and disadvantages in more detail.
