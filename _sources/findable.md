# Findable

</br>

The first step in (re)using data is to find them.  [Metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_Encoding_and_Transmission_Standard)  and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. [Machine-readable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-readable_data) metadata are essential for automatic [discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_discovery) of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process. 

</br>

*For data to be considered Findable, they should follow the following guidelines.*

1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier 
2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
