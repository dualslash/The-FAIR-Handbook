# Introduction
eHealth data or so-called Real World Data (RWD) drawn from health data sources, such as hospitals and personal wearables are arguably one of the most valuable and sensitive types of data. The use of this type of data has the potential to support research and facilitate product development within healthcare, digital health, public health and many others areas . However, this data is highly sensitive since health data reveals information about oneâ€™s health conditions, family members, ones psycho-social state and history. 
One of the main goals of this report is to describe possible techniques and technologies aimed at obtaining high utility whilst protecting the sensitive nature RWD in context of health data ecosystems. Utility here is defined as the value of data with regard to its completeness and validity. Disclosing data often results in striking a balance between safeguarding the sensitivity and utility. If sensitivity is high, little of the data can be shared resulting in low validity. Simply sharing the data as is can yield high utility but is often prohibited or undesirable for other reasons. Techniques described here will be evaluated in their ability to strike a balance between utility and privacy in the context of a health data ecosystem.
