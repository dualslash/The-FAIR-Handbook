# Welcome to The Playbook for health data sharing ecosystems 

</br>

This playbook is mentioned as a practical guideline for SME wanting to learn more about (e)health data sharing and re-use. 
The objective of this playbook is facilitate data sharing for creation and use of novel ehealth products and services as well as to ehance academic insights in health related questions. This playbook is a dynamic resource that will change over time, and will be updated on a regular basis.

For Who

The guidelines provided here aim to help those wishing to handle and re-use health data. It consists of information and resources with references to the state-of-the-art in the scientific community as well to practical advice and available solutions to further investigate. This playbook is written for those interested in learning more about the major themes concerning health data sharing and re-usage. 

For CTOs, data scientists and managers, researchers, software developers and policy makers.  
For organisations depending on access health data for their services or products.  
For companies wishing to innovate in the health space (re-)using health data. 

How to use

The playbook is developed around four important themes that may be addressed seperatily within the playbook. The playbook starts with a description of three major strategies for data sharing, then it elaborates on FAIR data, the FAIR principles and FAIRpoints. In the next chapter Privacy Enhancing Techniques are being discussed and in the last chapter the legal aspects of data sharing and eHealth are being discussed. 
These guidelines have seen rapid adaptation by the scientific community as well as the public sector, with the private sector also showing interest in the value that FAIR can bring.

Why share health data? 
Acquiring and storing data can be expensive. More reuse of existing data means a lower operational overhead and a more sustainable data strategy. In this digital handbook we will cover each of the aspects of FAIR and how FAIR can be implemented as a business data strategy. In addition we will discuss the importance of FAIR data and services, the core principles, use cases, as well as related technologies. 
 FAIR not only makes your data more manageable, but also makes your data more valuable by increasing the scope of possible application, speeding up data exploration and encouraging reuse of existing data sources.
