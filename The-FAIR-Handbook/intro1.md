# Welcome to The Playbook for FAIR data sharing 

</br>

This playbook is mentioned as a practical uideline for MKB that struggle with the data sharing issues for handling or re-use or of data. Importingly, the focus point here is data sharing for research or innovation purposes. This playbook is a dynamic resource that will change over time, and will update on a regular basis

The playbook is developed around three four major themes that may be addressed seperatily within the playbook. The playbook starts with a description of three major strategies for data sharing, then it elaborates on FAIR data, the FAIR principles and FAIRpoints. In the next chapter Privacy Enhancing Techniques are being discussed and in the last chapter the legal aspects of data sharing and eHealth are being discussed. 
These guidelines have seen rapid adaptation by the scientific community as well as the public sector, with the private sector also showing interest in the value that FAIR can bring. FAIR not only makes your data more manageable, but also makes your data more valuable by increasing the scope of possible application, speeding up data exploration and encouraging reuse of existing data sources.

To already get a glimpse of the possibilities that are enabled by FAIR data, see [this article on privacy-preserving data analysis](https://www.tno.nl/en/focus-areas/information-communication-technology/roadmaps/data-sharing/federated-learning/) presented by TNO.

Acquiring and storing data can be expensive. More reuse of existing data means a lower operational overhead and a more sustainable data strategy. In this digital handbook we will cover each of the aspects of FAIR and how FAIR can be implemented as a business data strategy. In addition we will discuss the importance of FAIR data and services, the core principles, use cases, as well as related technologies.
