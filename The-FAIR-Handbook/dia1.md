# Schematics

</br>

In this section we introduce four schematic diagrams that give a comprehensive overview of the process and structure of Fair Data Points (FDPs). These diagrams cover the following topics:

1. Data Integration Workflow
2. Data Sharing Workflow
3. Data Integration Architecture
4. Data Sharing Architecture

The workflow diagrams indicate the types of roles and processes that are involved in FAIR data production and sharing, while the architectural diagrams show the type of technology that is required to bring this paradigm into practice.
