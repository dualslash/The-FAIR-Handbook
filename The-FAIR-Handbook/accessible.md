# Accessible

</br>

Once the user finds the required data, they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) and [authorisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization). 

</br>

*For data to be considered Accessible, they should follow the following guidelines.*

1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol 
   1.  The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable 
   2.  The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary 
2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
