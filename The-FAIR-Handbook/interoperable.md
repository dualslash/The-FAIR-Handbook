# Interoperable

</br>

The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis), [storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage), and [processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing). 

</br>

*For data to be considered Interoperable, they should follow the following guidelines.*

1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation. 
2. (Meta)data use [vocabularies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary) that follow FAIR principles 
3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data
